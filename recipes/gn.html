    <h2>Description</h2>
    These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious. Garlic noodles were invented back in the
    '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, the recipe is a
    very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is
    very close.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3><strong>For the secret sauce</strong></h3>
    <ur>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ur>
    <h3><strong>For the Noodles</strong></h3>
    <ur>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ur>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3><strong>Step1</strong></h3>
    Gather all ingredients. Stir soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne
    pepper together in a small bowl for the secret sauce.</p>
    <h3><strong>Step2</strong></h3>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir just until
    fragrant, about 1 minute. Quickly stir in the secret sauce and turn off the heat.
    <h3><strong>Step3</strong></h3>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water,
    stirring occasionally, until tender yet slightly firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
    <h3><strong>Step4</strong></h3>Transfer spaghetti into the sauce using tongs, bringing some of the cooking water
    with it. Toss until well coated; stir in Parmesan cheese. Splash in more pasta water if noodles are too dry.
    <h3><strong>Step5</strong></h3>Plate noodles; garnish with green onions and red pepper flakes.
